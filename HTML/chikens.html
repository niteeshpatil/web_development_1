            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore">Bengalore</a>
            <!--creating link with name as benglur--> is widely regarded as the "Silicon Valley of India"
            (or "IT capital of India") because of its role as the
            nation's leading information technology (IT) exporter.[1] Indian technological organisations are
            headquartered
            in the city. A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major metropolis in
            India.
            \Recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Bangalore either the fourth or
            fifth-most productive metro area of India.[10][19] Bangalore is home to 7,700 millionaires and
            8 billionaires with a total wealth of $320 billion.
            <p></p>
            [20][21] It is home to many educational and research institutions. Numerous state-owned aerospace and
            defence
            organisations, are located in the city.
            The city also houses the Kannada film industry. It was ranked as the best city with a population of
            over a million under the Ease of Living Index 2020.

            <p>Bangalore is served by Kempegowda International Airport (IATA: BLR, ICAO: VOBL), located at Devanahalli,
                about 40
                kilometres (25 miles) from the city centre. It was formerly called Bangalore International Airport. The
                airport
                started operations from 24 May 2008 and is a private airport managed by a consortium led by the GVK
                Group.
                The
                city was earlier served by the HAL Airport at Vimanapura, a residential locality in the eastern part of
                the
                city.[156][157][158] The airport is third-busiest in India after Delhi and Mumbai in terms of passenger
                traffic
                and the number of air traffic movements (ATMs).<sup><a href="https://www.google.com/">[159]</a></sup>
                <!--give super sreipt above --> Taxis and air conditioned Volvo buses
                operated by BMTC
                connect the airport with the city.

            </p>
            <h3>Road</h3>
            <p>Buses operated by Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) are an important and reliable means
                of
                public transport available in the city.[167] While commuters can buy tickets on boarding these buses,
                BMTC
                also
                provides an option of a bus pass to frequent users.[167] BMTC runs air-conditioned luxury buses on major
                routes,
                and also operates shuttle services from various parts of the city to Kempegowda International
                Airport.[168]
                The
                BMTC also has a mobile app that provides real-time location of a bus using the global positioning system
                of
                the
                user's mobile device.[169] The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation operates 6,918 buses on 6,352
                schedules, connecting Bangalore with other parts of Karnataka as well as other neighbouring states. The
                main
                bus
                depots that KSRTC maintains are the Kempegowda Bus Station, locally known as "Majestic bus stand", where
                most of
                the out station buses ply from. Some of the KSRTC buses to Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh ply
                from
                Shantinagar Bus Station, Satellite Bus Station at Mysore Road and Baiyappanahalli satellite bus
                station.[170]
                BMTC and KSRTC were the first operators in India to introduce Volvo city buses and intracity coaches in
                India.
                Three-wheeled, yellow and black or yellow and green auto-rickshaws, referred to as autos, are a popular
                form
                of
                transport. They are metered and can accommodate up to three passengers. Taxis, commonly called City
                Taxis,
                are
                usually available, too, but they are only available on call or by online services. Taxis are metered and
                are
                generally more expensive than auto-rickshaws.[171]

                An average of 1,250 vehicles are being registered daily in Bangalore RTOs. The total number of vehicles
                as
                on
                date are 44 lakh vehicles, with a road length of 11,000 kilometres (6,835 miles).[172]</p>
